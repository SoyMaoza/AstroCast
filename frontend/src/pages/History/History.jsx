                <p>
                    In the early <strong>1980s</strong>, the global climate response was in its <strong>Era of Observation</strong>. Science, driven by systems like NASA's <strong>Earth observation</strong>, began to provide the <strong>undeniable data</strong> that quantified environmental damage and confirmed global warming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This evidence marked the beginning of the <strong>Era of Commitment</strong>. This was solidified with the establishment of key institutions like the <strong>IPCC</strong> and the signing of crucial political treaties such as the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols, where science was directly translated into emission limits and national responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the <strong>Era of Universal Action</strong>, led by the <strong>Paris Agreement</strong>, united the global community around a 1.5°C target. The evolution culminates with current technology: projects like AstroCast that use <strong>NASA's space science</strong> to translate complex data into <strong>practical probabilities</strong>, empowering people to make informed decisions.
